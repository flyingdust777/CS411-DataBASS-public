# Travelations - CS411 Project
This project is a social traveling Android app where users challenge themselves to travel to as many cities as possible.  We want to provide a social game that rewards people for traveling the world.

As users travel to multiple cities, the database will collect information about the users that have visited each city.  Then the app will allow users to monitor the cities they have visited as well as the cities their friends have visited.

## Description
This project is a traveling social media Android app where users challenge themselves to travel to as many cities as possible.  We want to provide a social game that rewards people for traveling the world. As users travel to multiple cities, the database will collect information about the users that have visited each city.  Then the app will allow users to monitor the cities they have visited as well as the cities their friends have visited.  When they arrive at a city, a new record will be inserted into a table in the database with the user’s username, the city, and the time of arrival.

## Usefulness
We think this app would be useful because it would give people an incentive to travel to many locations of the world, challenge themselves, compete with their friends, and have fun all the time. We are targeting the average individual, especially the people that like to travel a lot. It would also be useful for connecting people together inside of a social network, and eventually, the app could be used to store photos and reviews of different cities and places, so users could quickly see what exciting places are around them.

## Dataset
The dataset we will be using is the [World Cities Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/max-mind/world-cities-database) which contains over 1,000,000 rows. The dataset contains fields such as country code, ASCII city name, city name, region, population, latitude, and longitude. More details about this dateset can be found [here](https://www.maxmind.com/en/free-world-cities-database).

## Functionality
We will have a table in the database that contains what users visit certain locations and when. In addition, there will be another table that contains follower followee relationships between users.

## Basic Functions
Insertion functions will be used in several places. Every time a user visits a location, the app will insert a new record of the username, the location, the time of visit, etc. This will be performed by the server after it receives a request from the GPS when the user gets near the location. Insert functions will also happen when a new user is created, or when a user follows another user.

Deletion functions will be used in several places as well. If a user resets their statistics to start the game over, all their raw data records are removed from the database. If a user stops following someone, the corresponding relationship will be removed from the database.

Select functions will be used in different places too. After raw data has been accumulated, users will be able to search/query it to generate a summary page of statistics displayed on his or her profile. This information will answer questions like the following:
- What is the total number of miles traveled among all users?
- Which markers have been visited the most?
- Which user has visited the most markers?
- What is the total number of cities a user has visited?

## Advanced Functions
We developed two advanced functions for our project:

1. In our first implementation of the functionality that allows a user to check into a city, the backend would take in the user's latitude and longitude as input and query the database for the nearest cities to the user's location.  To do this, sophisticated trigonometric calculations would be performed for each of the over 3 million rows of the cities dataset to determine the distance between the city represented by that row and the user's location.  This query would run for approximately 7.4 seconds.

To optimize the runtime of this functionality, we implemented a spatial index on the latitude and longitude coordinates of the cities in our database.  This index is structured as an R-Tree and allows the database to query efficiently for cities close to a user's location without performing sophisticated trigonometric calculations on every row.  It reduces the runtime of the original query to around 300 ms.

In our final implementation, the query does not use this index and instead uses SQL "BETWEEN" clauses.  These clauses reduce the runtime of the original query to approximately 30 ms.  If we had continued to use the index along with these clauses, the runtime would be between 30 ms. and 300 ms.

2. When a user registers an account within the app, a verification email is sent to the email address provided by that user and a special token is created in the database.  After the user clicks on the link in the verification email, this token is removed from the database and the user's account has been verified.  The user is then free to use the app.

## Advanced Techniques
- Indexing (See first point in "Advanced Functions" section)
- Triggers (Implements functionality for achievements)
- Stored procedure (Checks if an achievement has already been acquired so users don't collect achievements multiple times)
- Transaction (The stored procedure)
- Prepared statements (Every query executed by mysql.connector is a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection and improve
                       the readability of the databass_api.py file)
- Compound statements (The stored procedure)
- Constraint (Foreign key constraints on "checkin", "follow", and "achieve" tables)
- View (A view for querying profile information)

## ER Description
The people that use the app (the Users entity set) will travel to cities (the Cities entity set) and check-in to them when they arrive (the Check-In relationship).  Users can also follow other users (the Follow relationship) to keep track of other users’ stats and compare their own stats against the stats of other users.  There are also achievements (the Achievements entity set) that users can achieve (the Achieve relationship).

For their attributes, users have a unique username, an email address, an encrypted password (a password hash), the date they created their account for the app (a join date), a number of points they achieved from achievements (a score), an access token to verify the validity of their login session, the number of times they have checked into cities (a checkin count), and a name they can display to other users (a display name).  Each city has a unique ID (City ID) that we create, a population size, a name, a country code, a latitude, a longitude, and a region.  All these attributes except for the unique ID come from the World Cities Dataset and will allow us to understand the locations and names of the cities.  Every achievement has a unique ID, a title, a description of the requirement to achieve it, and a point value associated with it.  This points attribute represents the number by which a user's score will increase when this achievement is acquired.

When a user checks-in at a city, a record containing his/her username, the ID representing the city, and the timestamp of the check-in is inserted into the Check-In relation in the database.  Since a user can check-in at multiple cities and a city can be checked-in at by multiple users, we believe the Check-In relationship should have many-many multiplicity constraint.  Furthermore, because a user can check in at a city multiple times to record all his/her visits to that city, we believe that the timestamp of the check-in needs to serve as an attribute of the key for each tuple in the Check-In relation.

Since a user can follow multiple users and a user can be followed by multiple users, we believe the Follow relationship should have many-many multiplicity constraint.

When a user acquires an achievement, the user's score attribute in the User relation increases by the number of points associated with that achievement in the Achievement relation.  A record containing his/her username and the ID representing the achievement is also inserted into the Achieve relation in the database.  Since a user can acquire many achievements and an achievement can be acquired by many users,  we believe the Acquire relationship should have many-many multiplicity constraint.
